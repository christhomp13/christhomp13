ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Chris Thompson,

I discovered a love for programming when I was craving a new experience and more enriching career path. 

My journey of learning how to code has been a challenging and thorughly enjoyable process. I've gone from learning the webdev essentials of HTML, CSS, and Javascript to diving deep into the world of React, express, and MySql. This has led me to creating apps that get me excited, and force me to level up my skills as a developer and problem solver. 

It is my dream and intention to become the best possible developer and continuously transform my career to help impact the world through technology, while realizing my true potential as an engineer and human being. 

This github profile is a reflection of my progress and focus as a software developer. I look forward to sharing with you the stages of growth I am going through along this path and demonstrating my commitment to the craft.
